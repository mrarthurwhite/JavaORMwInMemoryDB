Java ORM Hibernate working with an in memory DB Demo

ISSUES & STEPS:

1. could not do git push -u origin master 
had to switch to https:

 git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mrarthurwhite/JavaORMwInMemoryDB.git

then entered my user name and password when I did git push -u origin master
However it seems I have enter my username and pwd everytime I push to github
Which is unconscionable since I already have gone through generating the rsa keys.
1.1. changing the url back to ssh 
 git remote set-url origin git@github.com:mrarthurwhite/JavaORMwInMemoryDB.git

Because I am using another laptop I cannot just use ssh!

Now installing github desktop just to avoid SSH keys:
https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
"If you have GitHub Desktop installed, you can use it to clone repositories and not deal with SSH keys."
